This challenge showcase the backend of a social media application.  I will be incorporating NoSQL to show create a database of users associated with their thoughts and reactions (known as replies).

From there, it has the following models: user and thought.  Additionally, a reaction schema, which is a subdocument for the thought model instead of it being an actual model.

The following routes are created within the user:
* get user 
* get single user
* post user
* update user
* delete user

The following routes are created within friends:
* create friend
* delete friend

The following routes are created within the thoughts:
* get thought
* get single thought
* post thought
* update thought
* delete thought

The following routes are created within reactions:
* create reaction
* delete reaction

A walk through video will cover the routes explained above.
